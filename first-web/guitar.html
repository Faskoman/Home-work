    <p>The guitar has a rich history that spans centuries.
        Its roots can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Hittites and ancient Mesopotamia, where early predecessors like the tanbur and the sitar were developed.
        The guitar as we know it today evolved from instruments like the lute, oud, and vihuela during the Renaissance and Baroque periods.
        In the 19th century, Spanish luthiers made significant advancements, refining the design and introducing features such as the modern six-string configuration and the use of steel strings.
        With the rise of popular music genres in the 20th century, the guitar gained prominence as a versatile and expressive instrument, becoming an integral part of various musical styles, including classical, folk, blues, jazz, rock, and many more.</p>
