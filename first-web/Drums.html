    <p>The history of the drum set, also known as the drum kit, can be traced back to the late 19th century.
        Its development was a result of the need for percussionists to combine various instruments into a single, versatile setup.
        The modern drum set evolved from military bands and early jazz ensembles.
        Initially, drummers would play a bass drum, snare drum, and cymbals simultaneously.
        In the 1920s, with the rise of jazz and dance music, drummers started incorporating tom-toms, woodblocks, cowbells, and other percussion instruments into their setups.
        The advent of the hi-hat pedal in the 1920s and the introduction of the bass drum pedal further expanded the drum set's capabilities.
        Over the years, drummers like Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, and Ringo Starr played significant roles in popularizing and pushing the boundaries of drum set playing.
        Today, the drum set is a staple in various music genres, from rock and pop to jazz and fusion, and continues to be an essential part of the rhythmic foundation in music worldwide.</p>
